<h1>Firefox Reality Privacy Notice</h1>

<p>Version 0.1, effective December 17, 2019

<h3>At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.</h3>
<p>
That’s why we build Firefox Reality, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us.
We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox Reality for everyone. Firefox Reality for Microsoft Hololens is a new, experimental web browser from Mozilla.
Currently, it does not send any data to Mozilla.

<p><b>Windows Apps:</b> Microsoft's Privacy Notice describes the data Microsoft collects on the Windows App Store.
<p><b>Voice Recordings:</b> When you choose to use voice input for Firefox Reality, your voice recordings are sent to Mozilla and Google’s Cloud Speech service for
processing to provide you with suggested text. Mozilla does not keep your recordings.
